Tools to work with eXtreme Gammon xg-files

These are the tools that Michael Petch once wrote.
It is not a fork, since Michael's git repo seems to be down.

The files here are rather a copy of the files which was posted
to the GNU Backgammon mailinglist in August 2022. There is hence
no history and maybe the repo is not even complete with all files
from Michael.

All credit should go to Michael Petch! (A great guy!)

There is some documentation about the xg format at [this page](https://www.extremegammon.com/XGformat.aspx).
